# Final Project - Eth-Bay

The idea behind this application is to allow a seller to list assets for sale backed by an NFT.  The seller could then allow the asset to be bought directly, they could assign a loan to it, or other users who may want to hedge can create loans for the asset as well.

A buyer could then come an either buy the asset out directly or apply for a loan.  If the lender approves the loan the buyer would receive the asset and have to pay back the original loan amount.

If the buyer is unable to pay the loan the lender would have the ability to take back the asset and keep it or resell it.

## To Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= v16
- Yarn
- `git checkout master`

### Backend

- Run `yarn install` to download project dependencies
- In one console window run `yarn start-hardhat` to start the hardhat server
- In another console window run `yarn deploy-local` to deploy the contracts
  - This will display addresses from the contracts deployed that will need to be copied
- Copy the values from the terminal window into `.env`
  - AssetContract deployed address and replace value for `AssetContractAddress`
  - LoanContract deployed address and replace value for `LoanContractAddress`
  - NFT deployed address replace value for `NFTAddress`
- Finally run `yarn dev` to start the server

### Browser
